# IRL Gaslight™

### Spot the spin. Hold the line. Keep your receipts.

A warm, keyboard-driven defensive communication CLI for recognizing manipulation, rehearsing boundaries, answering bullies without becoming one, and keeping factual local notes.

IRL Gaslight turns a terminal window into a small reality-check toolkit. Open the command palette, choose what happened, and leave with a response you can actually say—not another argument designed to exhaust you.

It does **not** teach gaslighting, coercion, humiliation, retaliation, or psychological abuse.

## Install

    pip install --upgrade irl-gaslight

Then open the interactive experience:

    irl-gaslight

Use the arrow keys to move and press Enter to choose. On first launch, the shared IRL identity ritual can create your local profile and optionally link Google.

## What is inside

| Path | What you get |
|---|---|
| Pattern check | Phrase-based signals for 20 manipulation tactics |
| Boundaries | Calm lines with consequences you control |
| Comebacks | Calm, dry, and direct answers without abuse |
| Rehearsal | Practice against realistic pressure scenarios |
| Incident log | Factual notes stored only on your machine |
| Daily grounding | One deterministic reality check each day |
| Favorites | A personal response shelf stored locally |
| Safety resources | Clear signals for stepping beyond a comeback |
| Shared identity | Name, pronunciation, pronouns, avatar, and oath |
| Google OAuth | Optional local account link shared across IRL tools |

The library contains **110 curated defensive entries** across work, school, family, dating, friendship, and online situations. The interface includes a daily streak, clipboard support, favorites, responsive ANSI title art, and the warm burnt-orange IRL-Wisdom command-palette aesthetic.

## Commands

    irl-gaslight spot "That never happened. You imagined it."
    irl-gaslight boundary --context work
    irl-gaslight comeback --tone dry
    irl-gaslight rehearse
    irl-gaslight log
    irl-gaslight history
    irl-gaslight clear-log
    irl-gaslight daily
    irl-gaslight favorites
    irl-gaslight resources
    irl-gaslight upgrade

Add <code>--copy</code> or <code>-c</code> to supported response commands:

    irl-gaslight boundary --context school --copy

Interactive lesson cards also offer Copy, Save to favorites, Back, and Exit actions.

## Shared IRL identity and Google OAuth

IRL Gaslight uses the same local identity system as IRL Wisdom. A profile created in one ecosystem CLI can appear in the others.

    irl-gaslight profile
    irl-gaslight profile edit
    irl-gaslight profile reset
    irl-gaslight avatar
    irl-gaslight oath
    irl-gaslight oauth login
    irl-gaslight oauth status
    irl-gaslight oauth logout

Google linking is ready without API keys, downloaded client files, or environment-variable setup. The sign-in ritual uses OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE and keeps profile and token data local to the device. Secrets are never committed or bundled into the package.

Google linking is optional. Cancelling, going offline, or skipping login does not block the defensive tools.

For a browserless terminal:

    irl-gaslight oauth login --no-browser

## The upgrade ritual

IRL Gaslight checks PyPI, compares versions, and asks before installing:

    irl-gaslight upgrade

For scripts and confident terminals:

    irl-gaslight upgrade --yes

## How it works

    irl-gaslight
    ├── Typer commands
    ├── Questionary command palette
    ├── Rich terminal rendering
    ├── Local JSON defensive library
    ├── irl_identity
    │   ├── first-launch profile ritual
    │   ├── avatars and Wisdom oath
    │   └── Google OAuth with PKCE
    ├── ~/.irl_gaslight.json
    │   ├── favorites
    │   ├── incident notes
    │   └── daily streak
    └── ~/.irl
        ├── profile.json
        └── google_oauth.json

There is no application database, telemetry, or cloud sync. Gaslight state, the shared profile, and OAuth tokens stay on the local device.

## Safety first

The detector is a phrase-based educational aid, not a diagnosis. Context, repetition, power imbalance, and safety matter more than one sentence.

Do not use a comeback when it could increase danger. If someone is threatening, stalking, controlling, or violent, prioritize distance, trusted support, and local emergency or abuse-support services. Use `irl-gaslight resources` for the built-in safety checklist.

## Train the 5M offline model

The optional ML workspace trains a ~4.94M-parameter classifier and curated-response retriever without reading private logs or OAuth data.
